# DTEK2040-WebAndMobileDev
Assignments for course DTEK2040 Web and Mobile Programming (5 ECTS)

## Part 0.
[Part 0](http://users.utu.fi/sjprau/web2019/exercises.html#osa-0) exercises consisted of making a simple page with some HTML and CSS as well as creating three sequence diagrams describing the behavior of provided example web applications.

### HTML and CSS
- Because the page had to contain elements such as a form, list, table and at least one image, I recreated the product page for my current (and favorite) camera bag.
- The shopping cart is not implemented (that was not required) but otherwise the page is fully functional.
- The page is not entirely responsive (I did not finalize the footer behavior) but works for the most part on mobile as well. I wanted to come back to this and fix the mobile behavior later (but it was not relevant for this exercise so I left it like it is for now).
- Because I wanted to completely style the page (not required) I used **Bootstrap** to make the process a bit faster. There's still plenty of custom CSS though.
